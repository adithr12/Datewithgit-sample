    <h2>Messi</h2>

    <p>
      During the 2003â€“04 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club's
      ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[34] After being
      named player of the tournament in four international pre-season
      competitions with the Juveniles B, he was soon promoted to the Juveniles
      A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[35][36] Messi was then one
      of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard's depleted
      first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly
      notes that Messi stood out in first team training sessions: "He destroyed
      us all... Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an
      alien.

      Messi made his first team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a
      friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003.[25][38] His performance,
      creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff,
      and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side,
      Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[39] Barcelona's new
      star player, Ronaldinho, believed the 16-year-old would become an even
      better player than himself;[40] he soon befriended Messi, whom he called
      "little brother", and eased his transition into the first team
